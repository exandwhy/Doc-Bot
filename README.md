### Usage
<p>
To use Doc-Bot, you need to run the doc_bot.py file in your terminal or IDE. This will start a Streamlit web application that you can access in your browser at <b>http://localhost:8501</b>.
</p>

<p>
Once the app is running, you can upload a document in the supported formats (.docx, .doc, or .pdf) by clicking on the "Upload your doc" button. Doc-Bot will then summarize the document and index its content using the <b>GPTSimpleVectorIndex</b> algorithm from the <b>llama_index</b> package.
</p>

<p>
You can then type a question or query in the input text box and click on the "Send" button to get a response from Doc-Bot. The bot will use the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the indexed content of the document.
</p>

<p>
Doc-Bot will also display a chat log of all the messages exchanged between the user and the bot, including the time and date of each message.
</p>

### Credits
